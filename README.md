# react-chess-app


version 2.0 | 
17.09.2022

A chess app created with ReactJS.

I got into chess in late 2019 and i'm now continuously playing and trying to get better. One day I had the idea to create my own "chess app" and combine every feature I like from different chess platforms. This is now version 1.0 which includes a complete game of chess with every rule. Just give it a go for yourself. If you find any bugs, please let me know.
